# 🚲 RentalBike Optimization with Gurobi  

## 📖 Project Overview  
**RentalBike** is a bike-sharing company specializing in short-term bicycle rentals across different city areas. Customers can rent bicycles for any duration and return them to a different location, as long as it is within an operational zone.  

Since bicycles can be returned to locations different from their origin, **RentalBike** must frequently redistribute bikes to balance supply and meet expected demand. This project aims to **optimize the redistribution process** using **Gurobi**, ensuring maximum profitability while efficiently relocating bikes.  

---

## 🎯 **Optimization Problem**  
The objective is to **determine the optimal number of bicycles** to be moved between areas while maximizing **total profit**. The redistribution decision is based on:  
- Expected demand in each area.  
- Surplus or shortage of bikes.  
- Profitability of moving bikes from one area to another.  

The optimization model will help RentalBike make **cost-effective** and **data-driven** decisions for bicycle relocation.
